# Misael's F. End Learning Day-01

Hello... 😃👋🏻  
My name is Misael Randy Limpaty (ElMyosotisCode) your future Front End Developer Expert.

This project is my first project using HTML, it's only pure HTML without internal or inline CSS.

I know this project is very simple, but first project don't always have to be complicated. ✌

By the way, for my learning project I took "ATS Based CV" as my first project, because I want to create a CV that can be used to apply for a job in the future.

In this progress session, I created the base structure of my CV web page using HTML.

## Learning Module Session 1 -> HTML Basics

In this session, I learned about the basic structure of HTML, such as:
- HTML Document Structure
- HTML Elements and Tags
- HTML Attributes
- HTML Headings and Paragraphs
- HTML Links
- HTML Lists
