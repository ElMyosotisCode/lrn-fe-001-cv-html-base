# Misael's F. End Learning Day-01

Hello... 😃👋🏻  
My name is Misael Randy Limpaty (ElMyosotisCode) your future Front End Developer Expert.

This project is my first project using HTML, it's only pure HTML without internal or inline CSS.

I know this project is very simple, but first projects don't always have to be complicated. ✌

By the way, my learning project is about "ATS Based CV"
